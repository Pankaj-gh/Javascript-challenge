# Javascript-challenge
This project consists of 2 parts 
Part 1 Create a JavaScript code that takes in the data for ufo sightings
based on date, city, state, country, shape and duration. Create a table from this data which is stored in the
form of an object and display it on the html page.
This website should also allow UFO sightings to be filtered
by date.

Part 2. Fulfill all results from part 1 and allow the
data to be filtered by other parameters in the object such as
city,state,country and shape by adding multiple inputs in html code.
